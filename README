NAME
      HTML::EP::Explorer - Web driven browsing of a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
      <ep-explorer-browse>

DESCRIPTION
    This application was developed for DHW, a german company that
    wanted to give its users access to files stored on a file server
    via certain applications defined by an administrator. (See

      http://www.dhw.de/

    if you are interested in the sponsor.) The rough idea is as
    follows:

    The users are presented a view similar to that of the Windows
    Explorer or an FTP servers directory listing. On the top they
    have a list of so-called actions. The users may select one or
    more files and then execute an action on them.

INSTALLATION
    The system is based on my embedded HTML system HTML::EP. It
    should be available at the same place where you found this file,
    or at any CPAN mirror, in particular

      ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/

    The installation of HTML::EP is described in detail in the
    README, I won't explain it here. However, in short it is just as
    installing HTML::EP::Explorer: Assumed you have a file

      HTML-EP-Explorer-0.1003.tar.gz

    then you have to execute the following steps:

      gzip -cd HTML-EP-Explorer-0.1003.tar.gz | tar xf -
      perl Makefile.PL
      make          # You will be prompted some questions here
      make test
      make install

    Installation will in particular create a file

      lib/HTML/EP/Explorer/Config.pm

    which will contain your answers to the following questions:

    *       Install HTML files?

            If you say *y* here (the default), the installation
            script will install some HTML files at a location
            choosed by you. Usually you will say yes, because the
            system is pretty useless without it's associated HTML
            files. However, if you already did install the system
            and modified the HTML files you probably want to avoid
            overriding them. In that case say *n*.

    *       Directory for installing HTML files?

            If you requested installing the HTML files, you have to
            choose a location. By default the program suggests

              F</home/httpd/html/explorer>

            which is fine on a Red Hat Linux box. Users of other
            systems will modify this to some path below your your
            web servers root directory.

    *       UID the httpd is running as?

            The explorer scripts need write access to some files, in
            particular the configuration created by the site
            administrator. To enable write access, these files are
            owned by the Unix user you enter here, by default the
            user *nobody*.

            In most cases this will be the same user that your httpd
            is running as, but it might be different, for example if
            your Apache is using the suexec feature. Contact your
            webmaster for details.
